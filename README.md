# saqueos
This is a data-visualization & art project in which I addressed a political and social issue that occurred in Argentina with a person who ironically tweeted about organizing lootings in the city. The police visited his house in a clear abuse of government power. After this, Twitter users in Argentina filled their timelines with the keyword "looting" for a couple of days as a way of showing their rejection to what happened. I collected +8.000 tweets and counted the times "saqueos" was mentioned as a way of remarking how many times police should had violently visited citizens if they decided to keep this surveilant behavior.
