# saqueos
This is a data-visualization & art project in which I addressed a political and social issue that occurred in Argentina with a person who ironically 
tweeted about the organization of looting. The police visited his home in a clear abuse of government force. After this, Twitter users in Argentina 
filled their timelines with the keyword "looting" for a couple of days as a way to show their rejection of what happened.
